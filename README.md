# TrackLight
This project presents an innovative automotive spotlight system utilizing ultra-wideband (UWB) technology to track and follow the user's movements. The aim of this system is to provide enhanced visibility and illumination for occupants, enabling a seamless and personalized lighting experience. By integrating UWB technology, the spotlight can accurately detect the user's position and movements in real-time, allowing the light beam to dynamically adjust its direction and focus accordingly. This tracking capability is achieved through a combination of UWB transceivers strategically positioned in the vehicle and a wearable UWB tag worn by the user. The spotlight system leverages the UWB signals exchanged between the transceivers and the tag to calculate the user's precise location, enabling the spotlight to continuously track and illuminate the user's surroundings. This innovative solution enhances user comfort, safety, and convenience within the vehicle, eliminating the need for manual adjustment of the spotlight and ensuring optimal illumination is always provided.
